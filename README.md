Any sugestions and ideas are welcome. My end goal is to have a simple way to keep track of worked hours. As an intern, the standard amount of hours for each day is 7 hours (including lunch break). Any other users are free to set these daily hours as they please.

As a beginner, I'm mostly familiar to python, so it was the choosen language.
